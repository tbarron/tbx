1.0.2
 - Fix for breakage when setting a non-existent env var to None. We were
   attempting to del a key from os.environ that wasn't there.
 - Hold the version in version.py rather than hard-coding it in setup.py.
   In setup.py, make use of version._v.
 - Add test to verify that version._v matches the last git tag.
 - Rearrange the tests: lint first, version last.
